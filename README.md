The Country Explorer project provides a streamlined interface for exploring data on countries worldwide. Users can search for countries and view details like population, language, and currency, designed with responsiveness across all major devices and browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari). The project uses the REST Countries API to fetch real-time data and employs CSS Flexbox and media queries for a responsive layout. Notably, Safari may occasionally have trouble displaying flags due to API limitations. Developed in approximately 10-12 hours, this project showcases a minimalistic, user-friendly design with a focus on seamless navigation and data presentation.
